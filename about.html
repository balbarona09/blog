				<p class="text-spacing body-text">Hi there, My name is John Michael V. Balbarona.</p><br>
				<p class="text-spacing body-text">I started programming when I was 16 years old.</p>
				<p class="text-spacing body-text">Using C language, I learned the programming fundamentals 
				and enhanced my problem solving skills.</p><br>
				<p class="text-spacing body-text">I switched to java and since then, I jumped from programming language to 
				programming language without actually having to learn anything.</p><br>
				<p class="text-spacing body-text">I am currently learning web development.</p>
				<p class="text-spacing body-text">Every webpage in this website is created using pure HTML and CSS to practice 
				my skills in those languages while I am learning other programming languages, 
				starting with javascript.</p><br>
				<p class="text-spacing body-text">I built this blogsite to be one of my projects to put in my portfolio.</p><br>
				<p class="text-spacing body-text">My personal hobbies are playing chess, solving rubik's cube, and watching movies
				 and tv series.</p><br>
				 <p class="text-spacing body-text">I am quite good at playing chess, what I like about chess are bluffing, sacrificing, 
				 and planning in order to win.</p><br>
				 <p class="text-spacing body-text">My fastest solve in 3 by 3 rubik's cube is 10 seconds.</p>
				 <p class="text-spacing body-text">I am speedcubing since I was in 6th grade.</p>
				 <p class="text-spacing body-text">I can also solve 2 by 2 and 4 by 4 rubik's cube.</p><br>
				 <p class="text-spacing body-text">I like sci-fi, action, comedy, and some drama movies and tv series.</p>
				 <p class="text-spacing body-text">I have enjoyed watching Game of Thrones, MCU movies, Suits, etc...</p><br>
				 <p class="text-spacing body-text">In this blogsite, I will be posting about my experiences, opinions, tips and tricks 
				 about my hobbies, knowledge and skills.</p>
